# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to use

1. Run `yarn changeset` to create a new changeset
2. Follow the prompts to select packages and describe changes
3. Commit the generated changeset file with your PR
4. When merged, automated workflows will handle versioning and publishing
